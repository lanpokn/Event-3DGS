# Event-3DGS: Event-based 3D Reconstruction Using 3D Gaussian Splatting

## Introduction
This repository contains the research code for **Event-3DGS: Event-based 3D Reconstruction Using 3D Gaussian Splatting**. The code is designed to implement the event-based 3D reconstruction algorithm described in the paper and includes key components such as the photovoltage contrast estimation module and a novel event-based loss for optimizing reconstruction quality.

The code has been tested in a personal environment on Windows 11. If you encounter any difficult-to-resolve issues during deployment in other environments, please feel free to provide feedback.

## Installation
Follow the steps below to set up the environment and install dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lanpokn/Event-3DGS.git
   cd Event-3DGS
   ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies:**
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. **Additional steps:**
   - If you're using CUDA or other specific hardware, ensure the appropriate libraries (e.g., `torch` with GPU support) are installed.

## Dataset
To reproduce the results presented in the paper, you will need to download and prepare the dataset as follows:

1. **Event-Camera Dataset:** We use the [Event-Camera Dataset](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/davis_data.html) for training and evaluation. Please follow the instructions on their website to download the dataset.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Extract the dataset and organize it into the following structure:
     ```
     /path/to/dataset/
       ├── training/
       ├── validation/
       ├── testing/
     ```

3. **Dataset Configuration:**
   - Update the paths in the configuration file `config/dataset_config.yaml` to point to the correct dataset location.

## Getting Started
Once you've set up the environment and downloaded the dataset, follow these steps to run the code:

1. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config/train_config.yaml
   ```

2. **Evaluate the model:**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint --config config/eval_config.yaml
   ```

3. **Visualize the results:**
   ```bash
   python visualize.py --data /path/to/data
   ```

## Features
The repository includes several functionalities:
- **Event-based 3D reconstruction** using the proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method.
- **Photovoltage contrast estimation** using a high-pass filter.
- **Novel event-based loss function** for optimizing 3D reconstruction quality.
- **Pre-trained models** for quick experimentation.
